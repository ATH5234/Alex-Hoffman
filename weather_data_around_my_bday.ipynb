On my birthday (July 16) we see .32 was the highest amount of precipitation, as the other two years it was 0. The highest rainfall total seen was 2.06 which occurred July 22nd of 2019. Something that also interested me was that 0 was recorded on July 10th for all three years. In conclusion the precipitation totals seemed to be very low within that timeframe, you could infer some kind of drought occurred. \n"
